Important Warnings!!!
---------------------

The radio modules on all 100mW models are not 5 volt tolerant. If you connect 5 volt power to the programming headers, you may damage the radio module. **Only connect a programming cable that provides 3.3 volt power.** Fortunately, the other components on the receivers and transmitters are tolerant of 5 volts, and the radio module is replaceable if you damage it.

Always attach an antenna.
-------------------------

Never power on any receiver or transmitter for any reason without a suitable antenna attached. This includes
when you are connecting it to a computer for software updates. All receivers are also capable of transmitting.
